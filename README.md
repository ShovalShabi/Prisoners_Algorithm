# The Prisoners Riddle

*Hello and welcome to our Prisoners Riddle Game!*

### Background

Before we dive into code specifics we must tell you first what is story behind this riddle.\
The 100 prisoners problem is a mathematical problem in probability theory and combinatorics.\
In this problem, 100 numbered prisoners must find their own numbers in one of 100 boxes in order to survive.\
The rules state that each prisoner may open only 50 drawers and cannot communicate with other prisoners.\
At first glance, the situation appears hopeless, but a clever strategy offers the prisoners a realistic chance of survival.

The inefficient way to overcome this case is that to let each prisoner open  a random box and  if he finds it's number he can go out,
The chances that all the prisoners we succeed to so is 1/(2^100) which is 32 zeros after decimal.\
The efficient wat that can solve this case, is that each prisoner will open the box with his number and then,
the number that found within his box resembles the next box the prisoner need to open, and by this strategy the chances
to win the escape is 0.31 which is 30 times factor better.
